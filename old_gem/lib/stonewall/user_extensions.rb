    # This is the ugliest method in the whole gem.
    # You have a lot of freedom in how you implement your role system, and
    # I have to adapt to that.  You can have:
    #  - role as a string on your class
    #  - role as a singular has_one or belongs_to relationship
    #  - your user can has_many :roles, and they can be any object you want.
    # The only thing we require is that, if your role is a separate object,
    # it responds to a 'name' method with a string or a symbol that matches
    # the symbol you use when defining the permissions in your dsl.
